<p> 
There are 800 million players worldwide who play volleyball at least once a week.<br> Volleyball is a sport that is safe, fun and does not require extreme fitness. 
<br>
Since you don’t have to move around the court too much,
<br> it’s great for people who want a low-impact sport that will help them get fit without pushing them to their limit.
<br>
<br> 
For those who are a bit more competitive, the sport is fantastic because games can be really exciting and intense,
<br> 
but there’s always a net between you and your opponents.
<br> 
Beach volleyball is suitable for people of all ages, and men and women alike.
<br>
Anyone considering starting a new sport or exercise program should see their doctor first.
