Name: Kyle Tippett

Goals
	
-	To increase the number of weekly players from 100 to 150
-	To increase the age range from 35-50 to 15-50


Success Evaluation

-	Monitor the number of visitors to the website and compare to the number of new members to determine the websites contribution to recruitment.
-	Monitor the number of weekly players before and after the websites launch. Any increases can be attributed to the website. 
-	Check the age (since it’s not asked for in the sign-up form) of the new members and see if it fall in the target audience range. 


Target Audience

The businesses community already has members in the age bracket of 35-50, the website will be targeted at a younger generation (15-30), while not deterring the older members.
This will be done by a simple layout (not to confuse or overwhelm the older members) and bright colours of blue and yellow.
The focus of the website is to draw in potential fresh players with a large sign up drive, the secondary focus is to deliver news to current members.
There will be messages to sign up throughout the website’s content to assist in the primary goal and by promoting a fun and friendly environment
